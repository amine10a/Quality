This system is designed to detect defects in glass bangles using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It includes two main components: a training script (`model.py`) for training the CNN model and an interface script (`interface.py`) for real-time defect detection using the trained model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Pillow
- Tkinter (optional, required for GUI)

## Installation

1. **Python Installation:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Installing Libraries:** Open a terminal or command prompt and install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy opencv-python tensorflow pillow tk scipy
    ```
## Usage
<span style="color:red;">Make sure to change the path (dataset_dir) in model.py and (model_dir) in interface.py:</span>
